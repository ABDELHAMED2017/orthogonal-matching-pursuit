# Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
<i>Dhruv Ilesh Shah and Tanya Choudhary</i>

This repository contains implementation of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for the recovery of sparse (or compressible) signals, from their compressive measurements. The code in `main.m` replicates the recovery process for the video compressive sensing architecture proposed by Hitomi <i>et al.</i> in ICCV 2011.
